# Scoreboard

## About
This program runs a web server on the host computer at port 5555. The main server (`localhost:5555`) displays a basic scoreboard, 
while the management page (`localhost:5555/manager`) allows the user to change the displayed score.

## How to Use

**In order to run the server, you will need node.js installed.**

Once the source code has been downloaded onto your system, run `npm i` in the command line to install the necessary packages.
Use the command `node index.js` to start the server.
